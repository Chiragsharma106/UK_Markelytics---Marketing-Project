## About the Project
Markelytics, a leading advertising analytics company, wanted to centralize its marketing campaign data into a unified dashboard. The aim was to evaluate campaign performance, optimize ad spend, and provide leadership with actionable insights across products, geographies, and customer demographics.

---

## The Problem ⛔
1. **Fragmented Campaign Data**  
   - Campaign results were dispersed across multiple files and systems, making it difficult to track impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue consistently.  
   - With no central view, analyzing Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and comparing campaigns was inefficient and error-prone.

2. **Lack of Product-Level Visibility**  
   - While campaigns promoted multiple products, there was no clear way to identify which products generated the highest revenue, conversions, or click-through rates.  
   - Underperforming products often went unnoticed, causing wasted ad budgets.

3. **Geographic & Demographic Blind Spots**  
   - Regional variations (North, East, South, West) and demographic factors (age, gender) significantly impacted campaign success, but insights were not systematically tracked.  
   - Without this, tailoring campaigns to the right audience was more guesswork than strategy.

4. **Time-Series Performance Tracking**  
   - There was no structured way to monitor how campaigns evolved over months and years.  
   - Seasonality, peak performance periods, and year-over-year growth patterns were hard to evaluate.

5. **Scattered Insights Across Platforms**  
   - Teams relied on multiple reports for products, campaigns, and regional performance, but lacked a unified dashboard consolidating all insights in one place.

## Solution I Used ✅
1. **Unified Centralized Dashboard**  
   - A robust Power BI dashboard was developed to consolidate all campaign, product, regional, and time-based data (impressions, clicks, conversions, CTR, CPM, ROAS) into a single platform.  
   - Insights were structured into dedicated tabs, giving leadership a unified source of truth with both granular metrics and executive-level visibility.

2. **Campaign-Level Insights**  
   - Campaigns such as *Buy 1 Get 1 Festive*, *Black Friday Early Access*, and *Year-End Clearance* were tracked with detailed metrics — profitability, conversion rates, duration, and spend efficiency.  
   - Automated KPIs highlighted which campaigns were profitable vs. non-profitable.

3. **Product-Level Analysis**  
   - A dedicated product tab tracked **20 products** (e.g., Titan Hard Drive, Nova Coffee Maker, Omni VR Headset).  
   - Metrics included impressions, CTR, conversions, ad spend, and revenue, helping identify both top-performing and underperforming products.

4. **Regional & Demographic Insights**  
   - The dashboard captured **regional sales performance** (North, South, East, West) and highlighted age and gender-based engagement.  
   - Example: The **35–44 age group generated the highest clicks**, while Jaipur emerged as the top-performing city.

5. **Time-Series Trends**  
   - Year-over-year and month-over-month comparisons were built in to show performance evolution from **2022–2025**.  
   - Seasonal patterns and conversion peaks (e.g., April ’25 reaching 6% conversion rate) were clearly visualized.
